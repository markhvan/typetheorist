        <h3 class="essay_parts">Introduction</h3>
          <p>The mention of ‘types’ or their underlying foundations is often associated with the distinctions programmers make between different kinds of data. The difference between an integer and a string serves as an easy example of how types have revolutionized the way we solve problems within programming languages; however, type theory’s origins and impact on the philosophy of mathematics are less commonly considered by those who experience types exclusively in popular modern programming languages. This paper aims to provide a concise summary of some of the major developments that occurred within the field; from Bertrand Russell's discovery of set-theoretic paradoxes to his formalization of the type theory and its overlap with a different kind of logic and influence on philosophers including Quine and Church, who would formulate their own versions of similar theories. I will discuss the impact of type theory on the field as a whole and provide a discussion on how important Russell’s work was and is to mathematics in both past and present. Investigating the foundations of type theory is a dense task with many areas for exploration and while this paper will not cover all of them, the goal of this writing is to bring attention to some important and fundamental aspects of type theory’s history.</p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Thesis and Main Points</h3>
           <p>Uncovering the history of type theory and its influence on modern mathematics necessitates a careful study of the motivations for its discovery. Furthermore, it is important to understand the context surrounding how it was defined and built within mathematics. This paper will explore the origins and impact of type theory on the field of mathematics, specifically the motivation for its creation, as well as the significance of the different types of logic that emerged as a result of type theory. The first point of discussion will be Bertrand Russell's paradox and how its discovery was responsible for reformulating the axioms we use to define set theory. This will also include a mention of the role Russell’s paradox played in dismantling Frege’s attempt at reducing mathematics to logic in his system of Grundgesetze. The second point of discussion is centred around the two different versions of Russell's type theory that appeared in 1902 (theory of types) and 1908 (ramified theory of types). Russell's initial proposal of the theory of types in 1902 would lack the rigour of the latter, however, both were created with the intent of avoiding paradoxical statements found in naive set theory and formal logic. Following this, I will explore some areas of mathematics that emerged as a result of type theory, most notably Alonzo Church’s simply typed lambda calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, which served as a foundation for constructive mathematics that emerged in the 1970s with the development of dependent types. Finally, I will also explore the relevance of type theory as a foundation for mathematics, and how its popularity declined in light of its complexity and similarity to the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. I will also provide an opinion on the impact of type theory on mathematics as a whole, and whether we should reevaluate the significance of different mathematics depending on their longevity, or a variety of other factors. While this is a somewhat subjective question whose answer may lack the same rigour that’s required of a mathematical proposition, it is a relevant one to ask when reflecting on the most relevant or transformative moments in mathematics.</p>
