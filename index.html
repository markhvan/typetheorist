        <h3 class="essay_parts">Introduction</h3>
          <p>The mention of ‘types’ or their underlying foundations is often associated with the distinctions programmers make between different kinds of data. The difference between an integer and a string serves as an easy example of how types have revolutionized the way we solve problems within programming languages; however, type theory’s origins and impact on the philosophy of mathematics are less commonly considered by those who experience types exclusively in popular modern programming languages. This paper aims to provide a concise summary of some of the major developments that occurred within the field; from Bertrand Russell's discovery of set-theoretic paradoxes to his formalization of the type theory and its overlap with a different kind of logic and influence on philosophers including Quine and Church, who would formulate their own versions of similar theories. I will discuss the impact of type theory on the field as a whole and provide a discussion on how important Russell’s work was and is to mathematics in both past and present. Investigating the foundations of type theory is a dense task with many areas for exploration and while this paper will not cover all of them, the goal of this writing is to bring attention to some important and fundamental aspects of type theory’s history.</p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Thesis and Main Points</h3>
           <p>Uncovering the history of type theory and its influence on modern mathematics necessitates a careful study of the motivations for its discovery. Furthermore, it is important to understand the context surrounding how it was defined and built within mathematics. This paper will explore the origins and impact of type theory on the field of mathematics, specifically the motivation for its creation, as well as the significance of the different types of logic that emerged as a result of type theory. The first point of discussion will be Bertrand Russell's paradox and how its discovery was responsible for reformulating the axioms we use to define set theory. This will also include a mention of the role Russell’s paradox played in dismantling Frege’s attempt at reducing mathematics to logic in his system of <em>Grundgesetze</em>. The second point of discussion is centred around the two different versions of Russell's type theory that appeared in 1902 (theory of types) and 1908 (ramified theory of types). Russell's initial proposal of the theory of types in 1902 would lack the rigour of the latter, however, both were created with the intent of avoiding paradoxical statements found in naive set theory and formal logic. Following this, I will explore some areas of mathematics that emerged as a result of type theory, most notably Alonzo Church’s simply typed lambda calculus and Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, which served as a foundation for constructive mathematics that emerged in the 1970s with the development of dependent types. Finally, I will also explore the relevance of type theory as a foundation for mathematics, and how its popularity declined in light of its complexity and similarity to the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. I will also provide an opinion on the impact of type theory on mathematics as a whole, and whether we should reevaluate the significance of different mathematics depending on their longevity, or a variety of other factors. While this is a somewhat subjective question whose answer may lack the same rigour that’s required of a mathematical proposition, it is a relevant one to ask when reflecting on the most relevant or transformative moments in mathematics.</p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Russell's Paradox and Set Theory</h3>
          <p>The history of types is rooted in the discovery of paradoxes within set theory and Bertrand Russell's attempt to find an alternative solution for understanding the foundations of mathematics. In 1902, Bertrand Russell wrote to Gottlob Frege detailing his discovery of a paradoxical case in which one tries to determine if the set R of all sets that are not members of themselves belongs in R or not (Bell). The excerpt below is from that letter in which he raises his concerns regarding the assumption Frege uses in his logical formalization of mathematics.
            <br><br><em>“You assert ([Begriffsschrift] p. 17) that a function can also constitute the indefinite element. This is what I used to believe, but this view now seems to me to be dubious because of the following contradiction.” (P. 130) (Bell).</em><br><br>
            Russell goes on to outline the contradiction mentioned above, (if the set R of all sets that are not members of themselves belongs in R or not), and how the statement itself is paradoxical and clearly has no obvious solution. To provide some detail around how this was problematic for set theory at the time, we should be aware that naïve set theory assumes the so-called Unrestricted Comprehension Axiom, which states that for any formula ϕ(x) containing x as a free variable, there exists some set R = {x: ϕ(x)} whose elements are all the x satisfying ϕ(x). Though this assumption appears rather intuitive, the case where we let ϕ(x) stand for x ∈ x and R = {x: ∼ϕ(x)} results in the case of Russell's paradox (Irvine and Deutsch). These paradoxical results were published in Principia Mathematica in 1910 with its description of the vicious circle principle, which states that “No totality may contain elements definable only in terms of the totality” (Alfred North Whitehead and Russell, 
            vol. 1). Russell's discovery had vast implications for Frege’s logicism, as it showed that the axioms Frege was using to formalize his logic were inconsistent, the most notable of these being axiom V which ​​requires that any expression ϕ(x) is a function of both x and ϕ. Unable to find a solution to this paradox, Frege’s attempt to fully reduce mathematics using symbolic logic failed and would make room for new theories regarding the foundation of mathematics to emerge. In light of his discoveries and with the publishing of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Russell proposed what would be the first of two iterations of an attempt to explain the foundations of mathematics using his theory of types. </p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Russell's Theory of Types</h3>
          <p>	Russell's paradox was responsible for a great amount of uncertainty in mathematics in the early 20th century. Prior to its discovery, much of the work done by mathematicians was completed under the assumption that if you could name a collection of objects, then it was an object which could be mathematically manipulated. However, following the discovery of Russell's paradox, mathematicians, and logicians for that matter, were charged with rectifying set theory or providing an alternative explanation for the foundations of mathematics. While the ability to solve different paradoxes in mathematics was a large motivator for type theory, Russells also found value in the theory’s compatibility with common sense which made it favourable given its alignment with our intuition regarding mathematics. 
            Before providing a basic overview of the theory, it is important to mention that type theory is not an alternative to set theory but is instead an alternative to first-order logic (FOL). Type theory as a foundation can be described as a logical basis for mathematical constructions while set theory could be considered a mathematical basis for mathematical constructions. Providing an overview of type theory requires an understanding of propositional functions. In simple terms, a propositional function f(x) is something containing a particular variable x that expresses a proposition as soon as x is assigned to it. It is important to make the distinction between a propositional function and a proposition; propositional functions are ambiguous due to the variable ‘x’ which could take on numerous different identities. In fact, Russell goes on to argue that the defining feature of a function is ambiguity. As Russell stated in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, <br><em>“We appear to have a single thought which does not have a definite object. But has as its object an ambiguity that constitutes the essence of a function” (Whitehead, Russell)</em>.<br>A final point to note would be that due to the vicious circle principle, the values of a function cannot contain terms only definable in terms of the function, this is how his own paradox is avoided within the theory. The notion of propositional functions and their ability to transform an ambiguous domain into something else acted as the foundation for type theory and Russell's descriptions provide much insight into the value of propositional logic and the role of functions as a whole. Both ideas would be developed further in Russell's first formal characterization of predicative reasoning, the   ramified theory of types.</p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Russell’s Ramified Theory of Types</h3>
          <p>In his 1908 text, Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, Russell would formalize his previous work on type theory in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. The publishing caused a stir in different branches of mathematics until numerous issues around its complexity and similarity to the Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory arose. Russell considered a type to be a domain of argument (inputs) for which there is some value given by a function. In the case of propositional functions, these functions take argument inputs of a given type. To avoid the vicious circle principle, it also assumed that the totality of all propositional functions cannot be used in the definition of an argument of a particular type. Past this, Russell proposed that the difference in types allows for a hierarchy such that at each level of the hierarchy a propositional function can only contain inputs of a type lower than its own (Coquand). Readers should be aware that the ramified theory of types consists of two distinguishable hierarchies: the hierarchy of types (mentioned above), and the hierarchy of orders. The hierarchy of orders is concerned with segmenting terms of the same type into orders according to their internal structure, which further restricts the range of admissible elements for the terms in question (Enderer). Readers should appreciate the complexity of Russell's theory and his attempt to provide a much-needed foundation for mathematics at the time.
            Russell's ramified type theory was not the only candidate for understanding the foundations of mathematics following the discovery of paradoxes in set theory. Following soon after would come Ernst Zermelo who proposed his alternative set theory in which all variables range over sets instead of types. This set theory supports a much more elegant and flexible formalization of mathematics than any form of type theory (Friedman). Zermelo’s set theory was further extended by Frankel to include the axiom scheme of replacement which  states that the image of any set under a definable mapping is also a set. Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the axiom of choice became type theory’s biggest competitor, which is now considered to be the standard vehicle for the formalization of mathematics. Zermelo took influence from the esteemed mathematician David Hilbert’s work. He was specifically inspired by the programmatic element of his treatment of the foundations of mathematics as it emerged in the later 1890s, especially with regards to the notion of mathematical existence (Hallett). Zermelo’s new and improved set theory would be largely responsible for the decline of type theory as a foundation for mathematics. </p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Type Theories Reformulation</h3>
          <p>	The popularity of type theory as a foundational theory for mathematics declined over subsequent decades following its inception for a multitude of reasons. The technical complexities of the theory were seen as a burden from its initial proposal in Principia Mathematica and many of the proof-theoretic techniques used in first-order logic made the use of the complicated type theory somewhat redundant. Furthermore, the standardization of type theory made it similar to Zermelo-Fraenkel's set theory, as both were now capable of avoiding many of the set-theoretic paradoxes that had previously posed problems to the field. As such, the need to use a mathematical device as complicated as the theory of types was unnecessary (Collins). The intricacies surrounding type theory along with the availability of more palatable alternatives makes it easy to assume that type theory was merely a blip in the overarching history of the field of mathematics. Type theory, however, would see a resurgence in the future with philosophers Willard Quine and Alonzo Church who built off of Russell's initial work. In 1937, Quine suggested an alternative solution to type theory; his  proposal put forth that instead of dividing entities into individuals and classes of individuals, where the proposition of classes is sometimes illogical or inconsistent, we can instead put certain restrictions on what classes are supposed to exist (Klement). Three years after Quine proposed this amendment to type theory, Church would propose his own formulation of type theory known as simple type theory. Church’s simple type theory allowed for the expression of much more technical mathematical knowledge. A relevant aspect of Church’s theory was his assumption that functions were to be primitive truth values. Church also greatly simplified the notation by taking λ-notation to be the only binding mechanism in the theory. Though a brief overview, it is important to recognize Russell’s role in inspiring such gifted mathematicians to inquire and create their own version of type theory. 
            Another seminal piece worth discussing with regard to the influence of type theory is Martin-Löf’s intuitionistic type theory, which was published in his Notes on Constructive Mathematics in 1968. A basic quote outlining some of the main ideas from Martin-Löf’s is seen below:
            “We shall think of mathematical objects or constructions. Every mathematical object is of a certain kind or type and is always given together with its type. … A type is defined by describing what we have to do in order to construct an object of that type.” (Martin-Löf, P.)
            There is no doubt that Russell’s type theory has influenced the development of constructive mathematics. In Martin-Löf’s system, any proposition can be represented as a type and conversely, each particular type determines a proposition. He would create new types like cartesian products and disjoint unions, the former taking a variable x of type A and turning into some B(x) of type B (Douglas). As far as practical applications of constructive mathematics, it is often used in computer science, specifically, the modern field of dependent type theory heavily relies on proof assistant programs such as Agda or Coq, which employ aspects of Russell's type theory to formalize and verify proofs. John McCarthy, one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence, spoke to the importance of computer checked proofs and eloquently stated the following:
            “The potential applications for computer-checked proofs are very large. For example, instead of trying out computer programs on test cases until they are debugged, one should prove they have the desired properties.”(McCarthy). 
            In practice, using a language that supports type checking allows a programmer to build logic checking into their programs so that a compiler can check for any cases where the programmer’s own thinking and logic is incorrect, which would effectively reduce the reliance of programmers on testing code. While the importance of type theories as a foundation for mathematics may have declined, it will continue to demonstrate its value in the programming languages and proof assistants which have made the theory indispensable to their functions. </p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">The Mathematical Significance of Type Theory</h3>
          <p>From a foundational standpoint, I would argue that Russell’s work on his theory of types was not revolutionary in changing how we do mathematics today, at least not in comparison to his discovery of set-theoretic paradoxes that accelerated the axiomatization of the formal systems we use to understand math. It is important to make the distinction between the mathematician and the math that they have produced. Russell's paradox will be forever significant given the role it played in forcing mathematics to reevaluate its own set-theoretic foundations; however, while this was the inspiration for type theory, determining the importance of type theory should be independent of Russell’s own reputation as a mathematician and his previous discoveries. Type theory as a philosophy of math is not devoid of its own internal contradictions and Russell’s philosophy of mathematics and logic contains many different aspects, which often conflict with each other and perhaps prevent us from viewing his type-theoretic work in the same regard that we consider the theorems of Gödel, for example. With that said, expanding our scope to other fields closely related to mathematics paints a drastically different image of type theory, which continues to be the basis of much discovery in the fields of computer science and constructive mathematics, and this should be taken into account when trying to evaluate the significance of Russell's creation.</p>
        <h3 class="essay_parts">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Based on type theory’s complexity and the readily available alternatives it would be easy to assume that type theory was a short-lived mathematical affair whose relevance has greatly diminished since its discovery. This assumption, however, would be remiss. Type theory plays an important role in the history of mathematics and represents the value of re-evaluating the axiomatic systems we use as the foundation for any field. Type theory was responsible for influencing a variety of mathematicians such as Church, Quine, and Per Martin-Löf who would expand and reinterpret Russell’s work to develop their own contributions toward foundational mathematics. Math is driven forward by the constant innovation of new mathematicians building upon existing theories and ideas, and the far-reaching influence of Russell’s type theory should be taken into account when assessing its impact on mathematics as a whole. Though type theory did not follow in the footsteps of the more widely adopted ZFC set theory, it has become widely used in various areas of computer science and proof-solving programs and will likely grow in its importance as these fields continue to evolve. The circumstances surrounding type theory are worthy of note, and its impact on the field should not be understated, as it has percolated into other fields like computer science and contributed to other mathematicians' discoveries. </p>
